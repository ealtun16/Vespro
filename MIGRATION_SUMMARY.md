### ‚ö†Ô∏è Vespro Schema

The `vespro` schema tables were not found in the local database. If these tables are needed, you may need to run database migrations to create them first.

## Migration Scripts

Two scripts were created for this migration:

1. **`server/migrate-data.ts`** - Main migration script
   - Connects to both source and target databases
   - Migrates data in correct order (respecting foreign key dependencies)
   - Handles table truncation and batch inserts
   - Resets database sequences after migration

2. **`server/verify-migration.ts`** - Verification script
   - Checks row counts in all tables
   - Verifies data accessibility
   - Provides summary of migrated data

## How to Use

### Run Migration
```bash
npx tsx server/migrate-data.ts
```

### Verify Migration
```bash
npx tsx server/verify-migration.ts
```

## Notes

- All foreign key constraints were temporarily disabled during migration
- Sequences were reset after migration to ensure proper ID generation
- The migration used batch inserts (100 rows per batch) for efficiency
- Duplicate records were handled with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`

## Database Connection Details

**Local Database:**
- Host: localhost
- Port: 5432
- Database: vespro_db
- User: postgres

The source database credentials have been included in the migration script but should be removed or secured after migration is complete.
